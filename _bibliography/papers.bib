  title={Gaussian Splatting vs. Classical Photogrammetry: A Comparison for Virtual Backdrops},
  author={Philipp Haslbauer, Mike Pullen, Carolin Reichherzer, Aljosa Smolic},
  abstract={This paper describes and evaluates three end-to-end workflows from capture to reconstruction including photogrammetry, 3D Gaussian splatting (GS), and extraction of textured meshes from splats with the explicit aim of individuals unfamiliar with 3D reconstruction creating backdrops for virtual production with a central presenter by using a smartphone as capture device. We show that GS significantly outperforms the alternatives in our experiments.},
